I uninstalled the JBL app and use it without the app .. you can change from anc to transparency just by asking the Google assistant to do it ..so I didn't find a need for the app and also experienced some playback issues which were resolved as soon as I removed the app and even read some reviews that the app is causing playback issues .. the pros are good sound , good mics and overall apart from not being able to use anc with one earbud this tws is really good .., I got it for 7.5k for that price I'm really happy with these", "output": "sound, mics, voice assitant, call quality, ANC", "instruction": "Identify aspects from the input data or review provided"}, {"input": "Play Video\n Pros\nComfortablle to ears\nFast connectivity\nJBL app is available for our comfortable pith/mode adjustments\nBattery performance is good\nANC is good\nCons\nQuality is not up to the mark for the case\nVolume is not much high", "output": "Comfortable, fast connectivity, JBL app, Battery performance, ANC, Volume, Quality of case", "instruction": "Identify aspects from the input data or review provided"}, {"input": "I purchased this product in December 2022, and it cost me around 13,999 that time, last December 2023 my product warranty expired, and from 3rd Jan 2024 suddenly product stopped working, I don't know the reason, product neither fell into water nor out of my hands, it suddenly stopped working, and when I call to jbl customer care they are saying sorry we cannot do anything, this product is non repairable, I lost my 14000 rupees, and now it's trash to me.

The Pro+ would just beep and you would have to know which one you switched to. While this isn't a huge issue it made it sometimes difficult to tell. Now with the Pro2 you get voice feedback after switching between the different settings. The voice prompts can all be changed in the app to a handful of different languages or just off if you don't want it.  The gestures also were slightly updated, where now I can have my favorite assistant as a hold and still be able to skip, play/pause songs. This wasn't possible with the Pro+ as using an assistant used up all the gestures on the ear bud for the assistant. \nThe JBL app also got a nice visual upgrade for these earbuds and some new features. There is now a VoiceAware slider so you can adjust the amount of your voice you hear on phone calls. There is also more settings to customize the ANC which is nice. \nThe only thing I was hesitant on was the color. I usually get black but this time I got the blue. I'm happy I did, they look really sharp.\nOverall, I'm really happy with these. They fit great, have awesome sound and have an even longer battery life. I can finally use them for a full day of work. I tend to listen to music or I'm always in some meeting or call for work. So I tend to have these in for close to 8 hours on a work day. It's nice not having to charge them during my lunch break in order for them to last the rest of the day. \nI can't recommend these enough, Great Product.", "output": "Sound\", \"Fit\", \"Gesture\", \"Voice Prompts\", \"Battery Life", "instruction": "Identify aspects from the input data or review provided"}, {"input": "Absolutely in love with these earbuds!

For content consumption, these are some of the best sounding earbuds in this price point, and they honestly punch above their price point in terms of sound quality. \n\nHowever, if you are someone looking for great call quality for business calls, these are not it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that the mic is terrible, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not up to par when it comes to blocking our background noise. \n\nSound quality: excellent, 5/5 in my opinion here. Highly customizable with EQ and app features. You can really fine tune the EQ across a wide range of frequencies. \n\nComfort: again, excellent, 5/5. These are the most comfortable earbuds that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worn in a long time. I forget they are in!\n\nNoise cancellation: very good, 4/5. Excellent noise cancellation for this price point, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the best of the best. The noise cancellation is also customizable via the app and tunes itself to your surroundings and your ear shape. Cool stuff! I found that this did make a difference once I did this in the app. \n\nAmbient mode: excellent, 5/5. Conversations sound natural, like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not wearing anything. This is also customizable in the app as far as how much ambient sound you want to let in. Good stuff. \n\nStyle: subjective. The buds speak for themselves but I find them to be very stylish! The color options are awesome and the blue color is stunning. \n\nCharging case & Battery life: this little case is awesome. 5/5 It packs 30 total hours of charge and charges FAST. Both the earbuds and the case charge very fast and last a LONG time. Much longer than other earbuds I have used. I can get through a whole workday just fine, with room to breathe. 5/5 for battery life. \n\nFeatures: oh boy - 5/5 for sure. Extensive EQ options, a video mode for lip syncing (not an issue for me, even in audio mode, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to have!), talk through, customizable ambient mode, noise cancellation tuning, the list just goes on. These are very feature rich and customizable.\n\nConnectivity: excellent 5/5. These paired up quickly and reconnect INSTANTLY when taking them out of the case. You can also use either earbuds independently of the other. \n\nThe app: 5/5, very easy to use! Straightforward and easy to jump in and start tweaking to your liking. \n\nCall quality: here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we run into some not so great. 2/5 here in my opinion. To be fair, folks I tested calls with told me they could hear me loudly, however I sounded a bit muffled and they could hear EVERYTHING in the background. They said it sounded like I was on speakerphone and they could hear all of my surroundings. In a quiet environment, it was fine, but in even a lightly noisy environment, these did not perform well. These are fine for calls when you are in a pinch, but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy them for this purpose. \n\nOverall, these are an awesome set of earbuds. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very happy to see how far we have come in terms of truly wireless earbuds.

I can hear my music clearly in a loud environment as well. So I bought these to use primarily at work. I average 9 - 10 hours a day. Well in using these buds, I was only getting less than 8 hours on a full charge with noise canceling turned off. They also displayed an intermittent connection were the sound would go in and out. I thought it might be my phone signal but it wasn't. Music and video kept playing during periods of unstable connection. It hapened every single time after I connect my bluetooth to my new S22 Ultra 5G. I haven't had any other these problems with any other bluetooth device. Then the 10 hour play would become less and less. I'd only get 6 - 7 hours of play. I then bought a second JBL Live Pro 2 from an authorized vendor because I felt the ones I had were possibly defective. Since I only had the first pair for two weeks I sent them back for a refund. I got my second Live Pro 2, but the connectivity was exactly the same as the first pair. However, I'm only average 4 - 5 hours of play. Again this is without noise cancelling on.

There is an option to turn noise cancelling off which is great for when you need to be able to hear sound around you. Bluetooth connection is super fast. I was able to connect to the earbuds in a matter of seconds. \nI have small ear holes and usually struggle for these type of earbuds to stay in however I found it wasn't a problem and they stayed in using the smallest fitting silicone earbud cover.\nWorked great with calls, others could hear me perfectly and vice versa, which is the feature I'm planning to use it a lot for\nCons: it will take me a little while to get used to all the earbud touch features and remembering how different touches change settings\nNot a fan of the feature where music gets turned off if one earbud is out of the ear. You can manually turn it back on and then just have one earbud in. However when I was jogging and only wanted one earbud in, then manually turned the music back on, the earbud in my pocket kept turning music off. It's not a big problem now that I'm aware of it and maybe this is a standard feature for most earbuds these days?\nOverall I'm very happy with these and it will serve me great for the purposes intended.", "output": "sound quality, bass quality, ANC, , touch functionality", "instruction": "Identify aspects from the input data or review provided"}, {"input": "I got these a few weeks ago and so far they have been great, I use them for a while most days and still havent run out of charge so I  am very impressed with the battery.

I forget that I have them in. \nI wasn't expecting much from the noise cancelling function but the moment I turned it on, the sound of cars was severely reduced. It can also be customised to your ear using the app which improves it further. I have never used an ambient noise feature before this I coud leave the buds in but still clearly pick up on voices around me if I was speaking to someone so saves me from trying to remove the buds and lose them everytime I speak to someone. \nThe sound quality is great, it has spoilt me now as I won't be able to go back to the cheaper headphones I had before. Same goes for the mic, people could hear me clearly although slightly less so when I was outside walking, however I could hear them better than they could hear me. \nThey are easy to use as you can tap on the buds themselves for the most common changes such as tapping once on the left for ambient aware or noise cancelling, twice for picking up calls or hanging up, tapping once on the left for play/pause etc. Also if you take the buds out of your ear it pauses your music. \nThe only downside I can find and it is very minor is that it is sometimes easy to accidentally press the bud and change a setting when you are just trying to adjust or brush past the bud. \nOverall I would highly recommend these, I have tried out a few before purchasing these and found the quality and features on these to be much better than others that are similar but from different brands.", "output": "battery backup, ANC", "instruction": "Identify aspects from the input data or review provided"}, {"input": "My experience with the JBL Live Pro 2 earbuds has been nothing short of exceptional.
